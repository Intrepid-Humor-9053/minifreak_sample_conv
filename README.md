### 🪄 Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Convert Your Files**
   - Drag & drop your WAV, AIFF, or MP3 files into the app.
   - Optionally apply **fade** and/or **normalize** before converting.
   - Files will be saved as `.raw12b` format.

2. **Copy to Factory Sample Folder**
   - Place your converted files into the appropriate directory for your operating system:
     - **macOS:**
       `/Library/Arturia/Samples/MiniFreak V/Factory/Samples/Factory`
     - **Windows:**
       `C:\ProgramData\Arturia\Samples\MiniFreak V\Factory\Samples\Factory`
     > 📁 These are the standard Factory Sample folders used by MiniFreak V.

3. **Sync to Hardware**
   - Connect your MiniFreak to your computer via USB.
   - Open the **MiniFreak standalone app, NOT PLUGIN**.
   - A prompt will appear to **synchronize samples** — proceed with it.
   - Your new samples will be transferred to the hardware.

4. **Play Your Samples**
   - The new samples will now appear inside MiniFreak’s **Factory** list.
   - You can use them in the **Sampler** or **Grain Engine**.

> ⚠️ **Backup First!**
> Before adding or replacing samples, make sure to **backup your current MiniFreak state and sample library** — just in case.

> 🧪 **Test Gradually**
> While this tool has worked reliably in our testing, it's always a good idea to:
> - Add samples in **small batches**.
> - Test syncing and playback between each batch.

This is **not an official Arturia tool**
